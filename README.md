# bubble
3-Dimensional Voronoi Diagram Divided by Cones.

## Definition of Voronoi Diagram


## Starting Point
Although bubbling is elegant algorithm, the data structure and algorithm are complex and heavy.
However, contacted bubbles hinted starting point of an algorithm described later.

## Tessellation Algorithm
Our approach accepts a partial reconstruction.
Maybe novel approach. 
Please contact me if you know a similar one.

### Discretized Voronoi Cell 
Voronoi cells are represented as a set of cones in our discretization.
